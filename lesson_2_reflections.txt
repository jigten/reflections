What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	We create a git repository which creates a hidden .git folder. This is done to initialize the git repository for use with git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area allows us to add individually selected files to be committed to the repository. It acts as a buffer which can be edited so that the user can commit files individually.
