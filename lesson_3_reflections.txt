When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If I am working in a group project along with other peers and need to share the code and update frequently. Also if I am working on a big project, it will be goot have it in a remote repository as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Then we can decide when we want to update to the latest version present and gives us the freedom to decide when to update ourselves.
